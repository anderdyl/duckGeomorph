Welcome to pyeemd's documentation!
==================================

This is the documentation of `pyeemd`, which is a Python wrapper for `libeemd`,
a C library for performing the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD),
its complete variant (CEEMDAN) or the regular empirical mode decomposition
(EMD).

If you have any questions or problems with `pyeemd`, or you wish to
propose enhancements, please check out the main page of `libeemd`_. Also, if
you want more detail on the inner workings of `libeemd` and/or wish to cite it
in scientific work, please see the associated article_ published in Computational
Statistics.
